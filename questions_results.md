## Question: What is a food tour?

**Response:**

I don't know. The provided context appears to be about hormone-related topics and female reproductive health, but it doesn't mention a "food tour". If you have any specific questions related to the given text, I'd be happy to try and assist!

* Các loại hormone giới tính thiếu hụt ở người bệnh suy tuyến yên bao gồm: testosterone,
estrogen và progesterone.

* Điều trị thay thế bằng testosterone hoặc estrogen – progesterone là
đủ cho người bệnh nam hoặc nữ bị suy sinh dục và chưa có nhu cầu sinh sản.

* Estrogen đóng vai trò quan trọng trong sự phát triển của mô vú. Vì vậy, việc giảm lượng
estrogen dư thừa có thể giúp giảm thu nhỏ vòng 1 không phẫu thuật, đặc biệt ở phụ nữ bị mất
cân bằng nội tiết tố. Thuốc tránh thai nội tiết chứa estrogen và progesterone có thể làm tăng kích thước ngực.

* Lúc này, cơ thể chưa
kịp tiếp nhận và thích ứng dẫn đến tình trạng khí hư được âm đạo tiết ra nhiều hơn so với bình
thường. Bên cạnh đó, trong thai kỳ nồng độ hormone Estrogen và Progesterone có những thay đổi lên
xuống nhất định vào từng thời điểm. Mức độ dao động của 2 loại hormone này có thể dẫn đến
tình trạng thay đổi ham muốn tình dục (có thể tăng cao hoặc giảm thấp xuống hơn bình
thường). Khí hư được tiết ra nhiều trong giai đoạn này có tác dụng điều hòa cơ thể, giải quyết
các vấn đề sinh lý của chị em.


## Question: What are examples of a food tour?

**Response:**

I think I have a better understanding of the context now. Unfortunately, there is no direct mention of a "food tour" in the provided text. However, based on the fact that it mentions "sung Mỹ tươi được bán tại khu du lịch Suối Tiên" (fresh sung fruit being sold at Suoi Tien tourist area), I can try to provide some examples related to food tours:

Examples of a food tour could include visiting places where fresh fruits like sung Mỹ are being sold, trying various dishes made from local ingredients such as sung sấy khô (dried sung fruit), nước ép (fruit juice), or other monumenal foods.

Keep in mind that this is an educated guess based on the provided context, and I may not be 100% accurate. If you have any further clarification, I'd be happy to try again!
