1. Members are required to sign a Minutes of Confirmation and Commitment document before they can be officially considered as remote workers. This ensures that both parties agree on the terms of remote work.

2. Remote work activities should not interfere with non-project related obligations, which implies that any additional time taken due to remote work shouldn't result in Time Off in Lieu (TOIL).

Mẹ nên tập thể tập thể dục\nnhẹ nhàng, nghe nhạc, đi tản bộ, ăn uống nghỉ ngơi điều độ… để thư giãn và kích thích tuyến\nsữa. Bú sữa mẹ là cách cho trẻ sơ sinh tăng cân tốt nhất nhưng nếu mẹ không đủ sữa hoặc sữa\nkhông đảm bảo dưỡng chất, bố mẹ có thể tham khảo ý kiến bác sĩ về việc dùng thêm sữa công\nthức để đảm bảo trẻ không bị thiếu hụt năng lượng.
