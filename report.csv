1. Members are required to sign a Minutes of Confirmation and Commitment document before they can be officially considered as remote workers. This ensures that both parties agree on the terms of remote work.

2. Remote work activities should not interfere with non-project related obligations, which implies that any additional time taken due to remote work shouldn't result in Time Off in Lieu (TOIL).
